# Lecture45--Discussing-JWT-Cipherschools
In this lecture,
we have understood what JWT is with the analogy of a supermarket coupon provided by Mr.Shanthanu.
How an encoded script contains Header, Payload and Verification Sign.
How JWT provides tokens to the users based on their operations.
We have also visited jwt.io where we could decrypt the script and access the details in the script.
